#+TITLE: Digital Agenda Scoreboard - Development Environment

* Introduction

Once installed there is no requirement to rebuild the system each time
and only the services need to be restarted (using *sudo
/vagrant/scripts/setup.sh -S*). Once restarted, the following should be
accessible:

- [[http://www.digital-agenda-data.eu/][Digital Agenda Scoreboard (homepage)]]
- [[http://www.digital-agenda-data.eu/data][Digital Agenda Scoreboard (data)]]
- [[http://semantic.digital-agenda-data.eu/dataset][Digital Agenda Scoreboard (elda)]]
- [[http://localhost:1111/sparql][Virtuoso Sparql Endpoint]]
- [[http://localhost:8890/][Virtuoso Conductor]]
- Supervisor
- [[http://localhost:8080/][Tomcat]]
- [[http://localhost/][Apache]]
- CR     - http://localhost:8082/data
- Plone  - http://localhost:8440/Plone
- Elda   - http://localhost:8080/scoreboard

Files in /vagrant are shared with the host system, so any files which need
to be backed up or saved, etc. need to be moved there.

* SSL Certificate Generation
cd to /vagrant and then follow steps 1 through 4 decribed in:
  http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html.
Once the certificates have been generated, the system can be 
built and installed using the commands below.

* Building/Installing the system
The build the services and install all the required parts in the
correct place the following can be used.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
cd /vagrant ;
sudo scripts/setup.sh
#+END_QUOTE

The system will then need to be rebooted. This should only be
necessary once.

* Starting the Services
This command will be needed each time the system is restarted and it
will only restart the services (no rebuilding of software packages).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
cd /vagrant; 
sudo scripts/setup.sh -S
#+END_QUOTE
